# Intelligent CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

This project is an interactive simulator for classic CPU Scheduling Algorithms with real-time visualization, Gantt charts, metrics calculation, process comparison, and export options.

## 🚀 Features
- Add processes with burst time, arrival time, and priority
- Visual Gantt chart generation
- Metrics calculation:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Completion Time
  - Response Time
- Comparison Mode: Compare any two algorithms side-by-side
- AI Assistant for explanation of algorithms
- Export results as CSV & PDF
- Hover effects, animations, and interactive timeline bars

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented
- FCFS (First Come First Served)
- SJF (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
- Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
- Round Robin

## 📄 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- GitHub (Version Control)
